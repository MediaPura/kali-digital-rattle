# Handy Scripts for the Kali Project

When importing images for Kali, you want them to be at double resolution on the Apple watch. If you do the default import into Xcode, the tool does single resolution by default.

However, if you rename all of the files to have '@2x' right before the .PNG file extension, Xcode will import all of them at double resolution. It's a handy trick that will save you a bunch of time when importing big batches of the animation files.
